============

Homebrew formulas for SPUC (deprecated) and Spuce libraries

How do I install these formulas?
--------------------------------
Just `brew tap audiofilter/spuc` and then `brew install <formula>`.

If the formula conflicts with one from Homebrew/homebrew or another tap, you
can `brew install audiofilter/spuc/<formula>`.

You can also install via URL:

```
brew install
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/audiofilter/homebrew-spuc/master/<formula>.rb
```
